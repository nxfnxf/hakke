# hakke
C# plugin-capable decrypting tool

# Info
Reference the interface DLL (hakkePluginInterface.dll) in your plugin if you want to create a plugin for this application. Your plugin needs only one `Decrypt()` function that returns a string of the decrypted data.

I provided a sample plugin ROT13pluginSample.dll to show what plugins need to look like.
